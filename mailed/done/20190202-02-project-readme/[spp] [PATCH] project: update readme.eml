-Soft Patch Panel
-================
-
-The goal of SPP is to easily interconnect DPDK applications together,
-and assign resources dynamically to these applications to build a
-pipeline.
-
-The first version of SPP provides for the management of DPDK ports, and
-assigning ports to different DPDK applications.
-
-The framework is composed of a primary DPDK application that is
-responsible for resource management. This primary application doesn't
-interact with any traffic, and is used to manage creation and freeing of
-resources only.
-
-A Python based management interface is provided to control the primary
-DPDK application to create resources, which are then to be used by
-secondary applications. This management application provides a socket
-based interface for the primary and secondary DPDK applications to
-interface to the manager. The management application will use OVSDB to
-maintain all created and assigned ports.

+# Soft Patch Panel
+
+
+## Overview
+
+[Soft Patch Panel](http://git.dpdk.org/apps/spp/)
+(SPP) is a DPDK application for providing switching
+functionality for Service Function Chaining in NFV
+(Network Function Virtualization).
+DPDK stands for Data Plane Development Kit.
+
+
+## Project Goal
+
+In general, implementation and configuration of DPDK application is
+difficult because it requires deep understandings of system architecture
+and networking technologies.
+
+The goal of SPP is to easily inter-connect DPDK applications together
+and assign resources dynamically to these applications
+with patch panel like simple interface.
+
+
+## Architecture Overview
+
+The framework is composed of a primary DPDK application that is
+responsible for resource management and secondary processes as workers
+for packet forwarding. This primary application doesn't
+interact with any traffic, and is used to manage creation and freeing of
+resources only.
+
+A Python based management interfaces, `spp-ctl` and `SPP CLI`,
+are provided to control the primary DPDK application to create resources,
+which are then to be used by secondary applications.
+
+This management application provides a socket based interface for
+the primary and secondary DPDK applications to
+interface to the manager.
+
+
+## Install
+
+Before using SPP, you need to install DPDK. Briefly describ here how to install
+and setup DPDK. Please refer to SPP's
+[Getting Started](https://doc.dpdk.org/spp/setup/getting_started.html) guide
+for more details. For DPDK, refer to
+[Getting Started Guide for Linux](https://doc.dpdk.org/guides/linux_gsg/index.html).
+
+### Install DPDK
+
+It is required to install Python and libnuma-devel library before.
+
+```sh
+$ sudo apt install libnuma-dev
+
+# Python2
+$ sudo apt install python python-pip
+
+# Python3
+$ sudo apt install python3 python3-pip
+```
+
+Clone repository and compile DPDK in any directory.
+
+```
+$ cd /path/to/any
+$ git clone http://dpdk.org/git/dpdk
+```
+
+Compile DPDK with target environment.
+
+```sh
+$ cd dpdk
+$ export RTE_SDK=$(pwd)
+$ export RTE_TARGET=x86_64-native-linuxapp-gcc  # depends on your env
+$ make install T=$RTE_TARGET
+```
+
+### Install SPP
+
+Clone repository and compile SPP in any directory.
+
+```sh
+$ cd /path/to/any
+$ git clone http://dpdk.org/git/apps/spp
+$ cd spp
+$ make  # Confirm that $RTE_SDK and $RTE_TARGET are set
+```
+
+### Binding Network Ports to DPDK
+
+Network ports must be bound to DPDK with a UIO (Userspace IO) driver. UIO driver
+is for mapping device memory to userspace and registering interrupts.
+
+You usually use the standard `uio_pci_generic` for many use cases or `vfio-pci`
+for more robust and secure cases. Both of drivers are included by default in
+modern Linux kernel.
+
+```sh
+# Activate uio_pci_generic
+$ sudo modprobe uio_pci_generic
+
+# or vfio-pci
+$ sudo modprobe vfio-pci
+```
+
+Once UIO driver is activated, bind network ports with the driver. DPDK provides
+`usertools/dpdk-devbind.py` for managing devices.
+
+```
+# Bind a port with 2a:00.0 (PCI address)
+$ ./usertools/dpdk-devbind.py --bind=uio_pci_generic 2a:00.0
+
+# or eth0
+$ ./usertools/dpdk-devbind.py --bind=uio_pci_generic eth0
+```
+
+After binding two ports, you can find it is under the DPDK driver, and cannot
+find it by using `ifconfig` or `ip`.
+
+```sh
+$ $RTE_SDK/usertools/dpdk-devbind.py -s
+
+Network devices using DPDK-compatible driver
+============================================
+0000:2a:00.0 '82571EB ... 10bc' drv=uio_pci_generic unused=vfio-pci
+....
+```
+
+## How to Use
+
+You should keep in mind the order of launching processes. Primary process must
+be launched before secondary processes. `spp-ctl` need to be launched before
+`spp.py`, but no need to be launched before other processes.
+In general, `spp-ctl` should be launched first, then `spp.py` and `spp_primary`
+in each of terminals without running as background process.
+
+It has a option -b for binding address explicitly to be accessed from other
+than default, `127.0.0.1` or `localhost`.
+
+
+### SPP Controller
+
+SPP controller consists of `spp-ctl` and SPP CLI.
+`spp-ctl` is a HTTP server for REST APIs for managing SPP processes.
+
+```sh
+# terminal 1
+$ cd /path/to/spp
+$ python3 src/spp-ctl/spp-ctl -b 192.168.1.100
+```
+
+SPP CLI is a client of `spp-ctl` for providing simple user interface without
+using REST APIs.
+
+```sh
+# terminal 2
+$ cd /path/to/spp
+$ python3 src/spp.py -b 192.168.1.100
+```
+
+
+### SPP Primary
+
+Launch SPP primary and secondary processes.
+SPP primary is a resource manager and initializing EAL for secondary processes.
+Secondary process behaves as a client of primary process and a worker for doing
+tasks.
+
+```sh
+# terminal 3
+$ sudo ./src/primary/x86_64-native-linuxapp-gcc/spp_primary \
+    -l 1 -n 4 \
+    --socket-mem 512,512 \
+    --huge-dir=/dev/hugepages \
+    --proc-type=primary \
+    -- \
+    -p 0x03 \
+    -n 10 \
+    -s 192.168.1.100:5555
+```
+
+There are several kinds of secondary process. Here is an example of the simplest
+one.
+
+```sh
+# terminal 4
+$ cd /path/to/spp
+$ sudo ./src/nfv/x86_64-native-linuxapp-gcc/spp_nfv \
+    -l 2-3 -n 4 \
+    --proc-type=secondary \
+    -- \
+    -n 1 \
+    -s 192.168.1.100:6666
+```
+
+After all of SPP processes are launched, configure network path from SPP CLI.
+Please refer to SPP
+[Use Cases](https://doc.dpdk.org/spp/setup/use_cases.html)
+for the configuration.
