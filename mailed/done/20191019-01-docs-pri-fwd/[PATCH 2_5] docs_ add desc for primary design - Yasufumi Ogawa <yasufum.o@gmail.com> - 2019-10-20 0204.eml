Subject: [PATCH 2/5] docs: add desc for primary design
Date: Sun, 20 Oct 2019 02:04:40 +0900

As spp_primary is changed to support forwaring packets as similar to
spp_nfv, and user can choose using this forwarder or monitor for
statistics, add descriptions of worker threads and its usecases in
design section.

+
+Master and Worker Threads
+-------------------------
+
+In SPP, Both of primary and secondary processes consist of master thread and
+worker thread as slave. Master thread is for accepting commands from a user
+for doing task, and running on a master lcore. On the other hand,
+slave thread is for packet forwarding or other process specific jobs
+as worker, and running on slave lcore. Only slave thread requires
+dedicated core for running in pole mode, and launched from
+``rte_eal_remote_launch()`` or ``rte_eal_mp_remote_launch()``.
+
+``spp_primary`` is able to run with or without worker thread selectively
+, and requires at least one lcore for server process.
+Using worker thread or not depends on your usecases.
+``spp_primary`` provides two types of workers currently.
+
+
+Worker Types
+------------
+
+There are two types of worker thread in ``spp_primary``. First one is
+is forwarder thread, and second one is monitor thread.
+
+As default, ``spp_primary`` runs packet forwarder if two or more lcores
+are given while launching the process. Behavior of this forwarder is
+same as ``spp_nfv`` described in the next section.
+This forwarder provides features for managing ports, patching them and
+forwarding packets between ports.
+It is useful for very simple usecase in which only few ports are patched
+and no need to do forwarding packets in parallel with several processes.
+
+.. note::
+
+    In DPDK v18.11 or later, some of PMDs, such as vhost, do not work for
+    multi-process application. It means that packets cannot forwarded
+    to a VM or container via secondary process in SPP.
+    In this case, you use forwarder in ``spp_primary``.
+
+Another type is monitor for displaying status of ``spp_primary`` in which
+statistics of RX and TX packets on each of physical ports and ring ports
+are shown periodically in terminal ``spp_primary`` is launched.
+Although statistics can be referred in SPP CLI by using ``pri; status``
+command, running monitor thread is useful if you always watch statistics.
