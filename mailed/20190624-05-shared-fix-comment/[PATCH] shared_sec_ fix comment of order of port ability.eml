Subject: [PATCH] shared/sec: fix comment of order of port ability
Date: Mon, 24 Jun 2019 15:21:22 +0900
Message-Id: <20190624062122.22399-1-yasufum.o@gmail.com>
X-Mailer: git-send-email 2.17.1

From: Yasufumi Ogawa <yasufum.o@gmail.com>

The order of members of enum `sppwk_port_abl_ops` should be the same as
`PORT_ABILITY_STAT_LIST` and it is described as comment, but the name of
enum is different. This update is to correct the name to
`sppwk_port_abl_ops`.
