+Run ``bin/start.sh`` with configuration file ``bin/config.sh``. However,
+at the first time you run the script, it is failed because this configration

+Edit the config file before run ``bin/start.sh`` again. It is expected you
+have two physical ports on your server, but it is configurable.
+You can use virtual ports instead of physical.
+The number of ports is defined as ``PRI_PORTMASK=0x03`` as default.
+If you do not have physical ports and use two memif ports instead of physical,
+uncomment ``PRI_MEMIF_VDEVS=(0 1)``.
+You can also use several types of port at once.
