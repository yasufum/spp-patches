Subject: [PATCH] recipes: reorganize direcories
Date: Thu, 27 Jun 2019 13:41:22 +0900
Message-Id: <20190627044122.15112-1-yasufum.o@gmail.com>
X-Mailer: git-send-email 2.17.1

From: Yasufumi Ogawa <yasufum.o@gmail.com>

Recipe scripts are provided for some usecases in SPP documents, but
directory structure is messed up. This update is to reorganize them as
following in order to be easy to find each of recipes.

  recipes/
     |-- usecases/
             |-- spp_nfv/
             |       |-- dual_bidir.rcps
             |       |-- dual_loopback.rcps
             |       |-- ...
             |-- spp_vf/
             |       |-- ssh_login/
             |       |        |-- setup/
             |       |        |      |-- 1-start_components.rcps
             |       |        |      |-- 2-add_ports_path1.rcps
             |       |        |      |-- ...
