Subject: [PATCH] version: 19.08
Date: Mon,  4 Nov 2019 23:18:48 +0900
Message-Id: <20191104141848.30916-1-yasufum.o@gmail.com>
X-Mailer: git-send-email 2.17.1

This patch is to update SPP to v19.08.

* Add forwarder thread in spp_primary because vhost PMD cannot be used
  from secondary from DPDK v19.11 or later. Vhost is added to
  spp_primary instead of secondary. VM or container can be connected
  with secondary via primary.

* Change SPP CLI to wait spp_primary is ready. You do not need to type
  `status` until primary is ready anymore.

* Update config params to launch spp_primary with two lcores for running
  forwarder thread as default.

* To make building container image is done in a short time, separate
  building steps into two Dockerfiles, one is for installing packages
  with apt and another one is for compiling DPDP apps from source.
  First one is not required to run each time building image if the built
  image can be retrieved from Docker Hub. So, the second Dockerfile uses
  the image on Docker Hub without running first one. If you are in
  offline, you need to run first one to have the base image locally.

* Update docs.
