Subject: [PATCH 0/2] Fix bugs of SPP CLI

This series of patches is to fix tiny bugs of SPP CLI below.

* SPP CLI is terminated if target secondary process is not exist. For
  example, it is failed to run `nfv 1` without launching nfv 1 and SPP
  CLI is terminated.

* Completion for secondary process does not work until secondary list of
  SPP CLI is updated. It should be fixed because user might consider
  launching sec process is failed if it is not listed in completion.

Yasufumi Ogawa (2):
  controller: fix bug terminated if no sec ID found
  controller: fix compl for sec enabled immediately
