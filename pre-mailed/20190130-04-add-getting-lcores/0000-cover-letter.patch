Subject: [PATCH 0/3] Add getting lcores feature

How to assign cores depends on a decision of user, but made a mistake
sometimes because it could be complex if there are many cores and
several DPDK processes running on. User should be able to know while
making a decision of core assiginment.

This series of patches is to add a feature to inspect core usage of
spp_priamry. You can get the core usage from spp-ctl or SPP CLI as a
part of status info.

  spp > pri; status
  - lcores:
    - [0, 1]
  - physical ports:
      ID          rx          tx     tx_drop  mac_addr
       0           0           0           0  56:48:4f:53:54:00

It is also available to get CPU layout from spp-ctl, logical cores and
physical cores on each of sockets. It cannot be referred from SPP CLI
currently. Here is an example of getting CPU layout of single socket.
`jq' is a command to show JSON data in well formatted.

  $ curl http://192.168.1.100:7777/v1/cpus | jq
  [
    {
      "cores": [
        {
          "cpus": [
            1
          ],
          "core_id": 1
        },
        ...
      ],
      "socket_id": 0
    }
  ]

The rest of SPP processes are supported in a future update.
