Subject: [PATCH 0/2] Remove spp_vm

Hi,

As announced in previous[1], remove spp_vm in this update. Spp_vm is
still able to be used to connect between apps in the VM, but it is
almost the same as launching spp_primary and spp_nfv on the VM. In
addition, IVSHMEM is not supported in DPDK anymore.

Thanks,
Yasufumi
