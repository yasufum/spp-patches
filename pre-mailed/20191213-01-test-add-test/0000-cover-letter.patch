Subject: [PATCH 0/3] Add unit tests

This experimental patch set is for adding unit tests for spp_primary and
spp_nfv. The series of unit tests is for asserting the expected results
of REST APIs of spp-ctl.

The reason of why `experimental` is DPDK does not support all of
features of multi-process app such as creating ring PMDs or vhost PMDs,
and some of tests are still failed because of failures of the creating.

Yasufumi Ogawa (3):
  test: add test for spp_nfv
  test: add spp_nfv test for forwarding
  test: add test for spp_primary
