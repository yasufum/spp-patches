Subject: [PATCH 0/2] Change response of _get_client_id in spp_nfv

Spp_nfv returns its client ID as plain text. However, it should be
JSON as same as other secondary processes. This series of update is
to change the format in both of sender of spp_nfv and receiver of
spp-ctl.

Yasufumi Ogawa (2):
  spp_nfv: change _get_client_id to return JSON msg
  spp-ctl: change NfvProc to parse JSON msg
