Subject: [PATCH 0/2] Get spp_nfv's master lcore ID in status

To know which one is master lcore is required for considering core
assignment if master is shared among mulit processes. In SPP, master
lcore is not used for a worker thread and can be shared among other
processes to reduce the number of occupied cores.

This update is to add master lcore ID in response of status command.

  spp_nfv: add master lcore in status msg
  controller: update paring lcores for master
