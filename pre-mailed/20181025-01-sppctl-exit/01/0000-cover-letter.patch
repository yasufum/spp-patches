Subject: [PATCH 0/5] Add exit command support for spp_nfv and spp_vm

Hi,

SPP controller does not support `exit` command after it is changed to
request via `spp-ctl` because REST APIs for `exit` command is not
implemented. This series of patches is to add `exit' command for spp_nfv
and spp_vm. Spp_primary and spp_vf is also needed to add this support,
and updated in the next patches.

Thanks,
Yasufumi
