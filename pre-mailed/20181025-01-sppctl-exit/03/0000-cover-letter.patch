Subject: [PATCH 0/3] Update documentation for spp-ctl

Hi,

For spp-ctl is added as a new features of controller, documentation
should be updated. Explanations of spp-ctl itself and commands are
updated, but overview section and how to use section are still needed to
be updated.

This series of patches is for the purpose. It also includes a fix of
misc warning of duplicated labels in spp_vf command section.

Thanks,
Yasufumi
