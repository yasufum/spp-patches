Subject: [PATCH 00/13] Move JSON utils from libs for running cmds

There are many JSON utils in shared lib for running commands, and
hard to maintain because several features are defined in a huge file.
This series of patches is to separate JSON utils from other functions
and fix complex dependencies among them.

Yasufumi Ogawa (13):
  shared/sec: rename ops for setup cmd response
  shared/sec: rename functions for spp_mirror
  shared/sec: move principle JSON formatter funcs
  shared/sec: change order of args of JSON fmtters
  shared/sec: move JSON formatter to shard/secondary
  shared/sec: revise including headers
  shared/sec: move JSON formatters from cmd_runner
  shared/sec: move rest of JSON formatters
  shared/sec: move lcore funcs in response_info_list
  shared/sec: move ope cli-id in response_info_list
  shared/sec: move rest of ops in response_info_list
  shared/sec: remove local funcs from header
  shared/sec: refactor comments for JSON formatter
