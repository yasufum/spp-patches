Subject: [PATCH 0/2] Revise GSG chapter

As CentOS support was added to SPP, documentation was updated to
describe both of installations of Ubuntu and CentOS. However, there are
still some ambiguous descriptions and not clear for which cases, or
remained old descriptions in `Getting Started Guide`. This series of
patches is to revise them.
