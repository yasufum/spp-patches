Subject: [PATCH 0/4] Add specific RX and TX burst functions

In SPP worker processes, customized version of rte_eth_rx_burst() and
rte_eth_tx_burst() are defined to add features of VLAN or ring lantency
statistics. However, these features are not required from all of
processes.

This series of patches is to add burst functions used for VLAN,
statistics or both.

Yasufumi Ogawa (4):
  shared/sec: Add RX and TX burst without VLAN
  spp_vf: change to use burst funcs with VLAN
  spp_mirror: change to use burst funcs with VLAN
  spp_pcap: update include path of port capability
