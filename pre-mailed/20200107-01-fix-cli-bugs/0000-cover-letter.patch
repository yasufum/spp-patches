Subject: [PATCH 0/7] Update for fixing errors for CLI

There are some errors are occured if CLI reqests spp_primary for adding
or deleting ports even though no forwarder thread is running. Without
the thread, it has no mean to add or delete resources for the thread

This update is to add checking if there is a forwarder thread is
running, or refuse the request for the thread. It also includes other
tiny bug fixes.

Yasufumi Ogawa (7):
  shared: revise vdev prefixs of pcap and nullpmd
  shared: fix wrong port_type in parsing dev name
  cli: add filter for running pri commands
  cli: fix error in asking ports if no pri forwarder
  cli: fix terminated if spp_primary is not running
  cli: move logfile to under project log dir
  cli: fix parsing forward and stop commands
