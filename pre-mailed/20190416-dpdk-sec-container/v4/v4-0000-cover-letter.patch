Subject: [PATCH v4 0/1] fbarray: get fbarrays from containerized secondary

In secondary_msl_create_walk(), it creates a file for fbarrays with its
PID for reserving unique name among secondary processes. However, it
does not work if secondary is run as app container because each of
containerized secondary has PID 1. To reserve unique name, use hostname
instead of PID because hostname is assigned as a short form of 64
digits full container ID in docker.

---
v2:
  * fix typo in commit message
v3:
  * add fclose() after if getting hostname with fscan() is failed
v4:
  * Increase the size of proc_id to 33 and add boundary in calling
    fscan()
