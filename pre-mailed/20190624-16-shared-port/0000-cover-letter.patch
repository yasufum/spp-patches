Subject: [PATCH 0/3] Rename spp_port_rxtx

Enum `spp_port_rxtx` is used as a port attribute to have a direction,
RX or TX. It is not used to have a set of RX and TX, but defines the
direction. So, It is better to be named as `port_dir` or so. This series
of patches is to rename this enum for spp_vf, spp_mirror and spp_pcap.

Yasufumi Ogawa (3):
  shared/sec: revise enum spp_port_rxtx
  shared/sec: rename members of enum sppwk_port_dir
  spp_pcap: revise enum spp_port_rxtx
