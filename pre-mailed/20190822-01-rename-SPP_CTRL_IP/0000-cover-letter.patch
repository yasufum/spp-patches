Subject: [PATCH 0/2] Rename env variable SPP_CTRL_IP

For using SPP processes as app containers, environmental variable
`SPP_CTRL_IP` should be defined to communicate the processes with
spp-ctl. However, the name `SPP_CTRL_IP` is better to be `SPP_CTL_IP` 
considering the usage.

This series of update is to rename it described in sources and
documents.
