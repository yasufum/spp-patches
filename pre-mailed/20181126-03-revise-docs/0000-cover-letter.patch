Subject: [PATCH 0/2] Update docs compilation

Compile of docs has things to be fixed or revised. This series of
patches is to changes issues.

* Comple of PDF documentation is sometimes failed to embed images
  because latex is launched before creating images with inkscape.

* Version number is defined in Makefile and `conf.py`, and both of them
  are changed if SPP is updated.
