Subject: Update for avoiding status error

There are some errors are occured if CLI reqests spp_primary for adding
or deleting ports even though no forwarder thread is running. Without
the thread, it has no mean to add or delete resources for the thread

This update is to add checking if there is a forwarder thread is
running, or refuse the request for the thread.

Yasufumi Ogawa (3):
  shared: revise vdev prefixs of pcap and nullpmd
  shared: fix wrong port_type in parsing dev name
  cli: add filter for running pri commands
