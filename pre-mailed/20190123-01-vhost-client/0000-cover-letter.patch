Subject: [PATCH 0/3] Add vhost-user client mode

Hi,

Vhost-user in DPDK supports the client mode as described in [1].
Although it is already implemented in spp_vf and its siblings, not yet
in `add_vhost_pmd()` in shared library.

This series of patches is to add the client mode to `add_vhost_pmd()`
and enable to use from the rest of secondary processes supporting vhost
PMD.

Thanks,
Yasufumi
