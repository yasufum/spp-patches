Subject: [PATCH 00/17] Refactor command parser of SPP worker
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

Hi,

The name of group of spp_vf siblings is changed to SPP worker for
removing ambiguity by which prefix of libs of SPP worker `spp_` is
renamed to `sppwk_`. For this update, each of common functions and vars
should also be renamed.

This series of patches is the first step of the update.

* Rename `command_dec.h` to `cmd_parser.h`.
* Update all of functions and vars in `cmd_parser.h` to apply with the
  above changes.

Regards,
Yasufumi
