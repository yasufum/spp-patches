Subject: [PATCH 0/6] Run SPP with --file-prefix option

As more virtual network interfaces, such as memif or af_xdp, which have
good performance are supported in DPDK, or considering container
usecase, it has got been common usecases using several DPDK apps on the
same host. It means that using `--file-prefix`  is more general than
before.

This series of patches is to add file prefix in startup scripts. It also
make a change to `launch` command in SPP CLI to launch secondary
processes with the option. SPP CLI expects that the option is defined as
an environmental `SPP_FILE_PREFIX`.
