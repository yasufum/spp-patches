Subject: [PATCH 0/2] Add mirror command

Hi,

This series of patches is to add `mirror` command to `spp.py`. The
behaviour of spp_mirror is defined as SppMirror class to send a request
and get a response.

Here is an example to setup spp_mirror with this command.

  spp > mirror 1; component start mr1 5 mirror
  spp > mirror 1; port add ring:0 rx mr1
  spp > mirror 1; port add ring:1 tx mr1
  ...

To find out more, refer the help.

  spp > help mirror

Thanks,
Yasufumi
