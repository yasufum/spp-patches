Subject: [PATCH 00/10] Move help messages of CLI in shell.py

SPP CLI uses python standard `cmd` library for implementing interactive
environment. For using `help` command of `cmd` lib, you define help
message as a comment of method starts with `do_` which defines a
behaviour of command as default.

However, SPP CLI have got supported many commands and the number of
lines of `shell.py` is over 1,000 or more. It should be changed to
move help messages outside of the file for considering to add
additional commands in future releases possibly.

This series of update is to fix the issue. Add methods start with
`help_` and define help messages in the methods because `cmd` calls
it for help instead of using comments if defined. By this update,
all of classes defined in `src/controller/commands` has method help()
for the message. For some of commands which are implemented without
class, such as `pwd` or `ls`, it is changed to define help messages as
a dict of command name and message in `help_msg.py`.
