+SPP Primary
+-----------
+
+SPP is originally derived from
+`Client-Server Multi-process Example
+<https://doc.dpdk.org/guides/sample_app_ug/multi_process.html#client-server-multi-process-example>`_
+of
+`Multi-process Sample Application
+<https://doc.dpdk.org/guides/sample_app_ug/multi_process.html>`_
+in DPDK's sample applications.
+``spp_primary`` is a server process for other secondary processes and
+basically working as described in
+"How the Application Works" section of the sample application.
+
+However, there are also differences between ``spp_primary`` and
+the server process of the sample application.
+``spp_primary`` has no limitation of the number of secondary processes.
+It does not work for packet forwaring, but just provide rings and memory pools
+for secondary processes.
