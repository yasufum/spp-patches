Subject: [PATCH 0/4] Move vf/common to under shared directory

Spp_vf and its siblings use common libs `srv/vf/common`. However, it is
not good design considering conventions, but should be placed
`src/shared` in the case of SPP. In addition, codes of spp_vf siblings
are not neat and tightly coupled and many of functions in `vf/common`
uses spp_vf siblings and vice versa.

This series of patches is to fix the issue by moving common libs to
under `src/shared` and remove dependency referring from common
functions to each of siblings. However, some of functions used specific
sibling, which are not common actually, are still remained as
`src/shared/secondary/spp_worker_th/vf_deps.h`
because of too much complexity of data structure and functions. This
`vf_deps.h` is released in next update, but will be removed from shared
dir in a future update for refactoring.

Yasufumi Ogawa (4):
  spp_vf: move common of vf siblings to shared dir
  spp_vf: update makefile for moved common files
  spp_vf: update include paths
  spp_vf: remove dependency from common functions
