Subject: [PATCH 00/11] Refactor libs for classifier in spp_vf

Functions for classifier table are hard to maintain because for long
names of functions and variables, complex dependencies of shared libs
and dedicated functions, or so.

This update is to fix these issues. Some of dependencies are still
remained, but reduced by separating many dedicated functions from shared
libs or adding comments for explaining.

Yasufumi Ogawa (11):
  shared/sec: refactor defines of VLAN in spp_vf
  shared/sec: rename struct mac_classification
  shared/sec: refactor comments in vf_deps.h
  shared/sec: rename struct classified_data
  shared/sec: revise usage of term component_info
  shared/sec: revise members of struct cls_port_info
  shared/sec: rename func free_mac_classification
  shared/sec: refactor updating classifier info
  shared/sec: refactor updating forwarder
  shared/sec: refactor getting classifier status
  shared/sec: refactor setup cls table stat in JSON
