Subject: [PATCH 0/5] update SPP CLI

Hi,

This series of patches is for three updates for SPP CLI. It also include
other misc upates for refactoring.

1. Change sec command to nfv

As suggested in [1], there are several commands in SPP CLI for managing
secondary processes, `sec`, `vf` and `mirror`, and `sec` should be
changed to `nfv`.

2. Add checking for add and del commands

To avoid invalid operations for ports, add checking for the operations.
If you add a port which is already registered actually, it might cause
a problem.

3. Update bye command to support spp_vf and spp_mirror

Bye command is available ony for spp_nfv because spp_vf and spp_mirror
does not provide `exit` command for graceful termination. This update is
to add exiting spp_vf and spp_mirror with `bye` command for graceful
shutdown.

Thanks,
Yasufumi
