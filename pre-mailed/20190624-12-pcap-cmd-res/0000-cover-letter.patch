Subject: [PATCH 0/2] Rename struct cmd_response

Struct cmd_response is to define a set of combinations of tag and ope
function, so the name is not appropriate considering this feature.
This update is to rename it to `cmd_res_formatter_ops` for spp_vf,
spp_mirror and spp_pcap.

Yasufumi Ogawa (2):
  shared/sec: change name of struct cmd_response
  spp_pcap: change name of struct cmd_response
