Subject: [PATCH 0/1] Change email address in MAINTAINER

Hi,

For email usage policy was changed in NTT, my email address
`ogawa.yasufumi@lab.ntt.co.jp` was discarded. Although recieving emails
for the address is transferred to new account for a while, it is going
to be disabled.Because it is not allowed to use `git send-email` for the
new account, I have started gmail `yasufum.o@gmail.com` instead of my
company's email.

This patch is to update my email in MAINTAINER file.

Thanks,
Yasufumi
