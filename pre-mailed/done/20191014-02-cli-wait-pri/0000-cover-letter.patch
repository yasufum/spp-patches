Subject: [PATCH 0/2] Revise CLI for waiting spp_primary launched

For SPP CLI, waiting spp_primary launched is useful, but no need if it
is already launched. This update is to change the feature as optional.
SPP CLI waits primary if `--wait-pri` is given.

  $ python3 src/spp.py --wait-pri

This series of update is to update SPP CLI to do that, and revise output
messages.

Yasufumi Ogawa (2):
  cli: output time to start spp_primary
  cli: change to wait spp_primary as optional
