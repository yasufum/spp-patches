Subject: [PATCH 0/3] Update Secondary Commands section

Hi,

This series of patches is to update `Secondary Commands` section in the
command reference. It is because SPP has several types of secondary
process and it can be managed from spp-ctl and spp.py, so I think now it
the time to update this section.

By this update, spp_vf commands are moved to `Secondary Commands`.
Spp_mirror introduced recently is also added to this section. It also
includes to correct typos in examples of spp_vf commands.

Thanks,
Yasufumi
