Subject: [PATCH 0/5] Refactor SPP controller

This series of patches is for misc updates of SPP controller.

* Change the name of directory of dynamically loaded commands. It is
  named as 'command', but ambiguous with 'commands' directory of
  delegator classes. So its name is changed to 'plugins'.

* Terminate SPP controller while launching if spp-ctl is not running
  because spp-ctl must be required for requesting and it is no meaning
  to run just SPP controller.

* Move '.spp_history' to home directory to be referred from any of
  directory.

* Move to the definition of port types to 'spp_common.py'.

* Remove SECONDARY_LIST in 'spp_common.py' because it is not used
  anymore.

Yasufumi Ogawa (5):
  controller: change name of plugins directory
  controller: exit controller if spp-ctl not running
  controller: move spp_history to home directory
  controller: move PORT_TYPES to spp_common
  controller: remove SECONDARY_LIST
