Subject: [PATCH 0/8] Add launch command to spp_primary

This series of patches is to add `launch` command which is used to
launch secondary process from spp_primary. For this update, spp-ctl and
SPP CLI are also update to support the command.

Spp_primary receives the command via tcp port 5555 and launches
requested secondary process by running `sec_launcher.py` script. The
reason of calling from the script is to avoid secondary be child
process.

Spp-ctl has REST API of PUT method for launch commnad. Request body
consists of client ID, process name and options of the secondary.
Here is an example.

  # request body params for launching spp_nfv with sec ID 1
  {
    "client_id": 1,
    "proc_name": "spp_nfv",
    "eal": {
      "-l": "1-2", "-m": 512, ...
    },
    "app": {
      "-n": 1, "-s": "127.0.0.1:6666"
    }
  }

You can try to launch it from spp-ctl with curl command.

  $ curl -X PUT -d '{"client_id":1,"proc_name":"spp_nfv",...}' \
    http://127.0.0.1:7777/v1/primary/launch

SPP CLI supports launch command more easy way to use. You notice that
some of mandatory options such as `--proc-type` are missing. These
options are completed in SPP CLI before sending the request. This
comamnd also supporting TAB completion as same as other commands.

  spp > pri; launch nfv 1 -l 1-2 -m 512 -- -n 1 -s ...
