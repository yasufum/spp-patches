Subject: [PATCH 0/2] Update of SPP Container

Hi,

This update is for SPP Container. Fix bug of creating `env.sh` and
change binding IP address in spp-ctl from `127.0.0.1` to given IP
address to be enabled to find from inside containers. If IP address
is not given from user, default `localhost` is assigned.

Thanks,
Yasufumi
