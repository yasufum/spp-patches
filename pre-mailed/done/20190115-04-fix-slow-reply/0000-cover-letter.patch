Subject: [PATCH 0/4] Fix bug of fixing slow command reply

This update is to fix incorrect fixing of slow command reply for spp_vf
and spp_mirror. It was applied as following updates, but not fixed the
problem.

* ab5183201c02 ("spp_vf: add sleep after disconnection detection")
* 5eea2dfa5420 ("fix slow response of command")

To reduce time for making command reply, replace sleep(1) to usleep(100)
for, and add another sleep(1) to avoid sending too much requests if sock
is closed and retry in previous patches. However, response is still slow
because the place of added sleep(1) is incorrect.

This series of update is to fix the problem. It also includes a
definition of interval time `CONN_RETRY_USEC` to be configured in micro
sec.

  shared: define interval time to retry connection
  primary: change interval to retry connection
  spp_nfv: change interval to retry connection
  spp_vf: fix bug of fixing slow command reply
