Subject: [PATCH 0/8] Update topo to support other than spp_nfv

Topo command is to output a network diagram graphically and useful for
users to understand the network configuration. However, it is still
experimental and the feature is very limited. It only supports spp_nfv,
and three types of ports.

This series of update is to add supported types of secondaries and
ports. Now all of secondaries and almost of ports are supprted in topo.

This update is also fix a problem in which graph cannot be resized if
config param `topo_size` is changed. For this fix, `topo_resize`
command is removed because it is not required anymore.
