Subject: [PATCH 0/3] Fix assigning wrong master lcore

In spp_vf, spp_mirror and spp_pcap, master lcore is always set as 0 and
cannot to others. It is because rte_get_master_lcore() returns 0 if it
is called before rte_eal_init().

This series of patches is to fix the issue for each of processes by
moving rte_eal_init() before rte_get_master_lcore().

Yasufumi Ogawa (3):
  spp_vf: fix wrong master lcore other than 0
  spp_mirror: fix wrong master lcore other than 0
  spp_pcap: fix wrong master lcore other than 0
