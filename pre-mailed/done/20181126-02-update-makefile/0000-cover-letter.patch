Subject: [PATCH 0/3] Revise makefile

Some of Makefiles of SPP does not work property and need to be revised.
This patches are to fix the problems. It also include changing to use
GNUmakefile instead of Makefile as in DPDK.

* It does not check dependency for compilation. If you update some of
  source codes, you need to `make clean` before `make`.

* `Makefile.spp` is used to compile DPDK with options for testing.
  However, target is remained as old `x86_64-ivshmem-linuxapp-gcc`.

Yasufumi Ogawa (3):
  makefile: fix problem of dependency is not checked
  makefile: introduce GNUmakefile
  makefile: update Makefile for testing DPDK
