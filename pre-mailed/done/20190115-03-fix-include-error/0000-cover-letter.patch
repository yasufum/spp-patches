Subject: [PATCH 0/6] Refactor for including headers

This series of update is to refactor for including functions and
definitions appropriately.

* Change libs for adding ports in `shared/secondary` from inline to
  ordinary to avoid `not used` error during compilation. This libs are
  not used for packet forwarding and no need to be inline function.

* Remove definition of RTE_LOGTYPE_APP from `common.h` because tag of
  log message should not be `APP` but the name of process, for instance,
  `SPP_PRI`, `SPP_NFV` or so.

* Add definition of `RTE_LOGTYPE_*` for each of secondary processes.

* Update makefiles in each of secondaries to change include path from 
  `-I$(SRCDIR)/../shared` to `-I$(SRCDIR)/../`. It is because for
  including explicitly from `shared` directory in each of codes.
