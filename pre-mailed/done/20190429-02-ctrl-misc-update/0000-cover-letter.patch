Subject: [PATCH 0/2] Fix misc issues of python scripts

* As PyYAML has changed to require load() specify `Loader` option
  explicitly or show warning message, add this option to the method
  calling.

* Putting executable file in `src` directory is not recommended, but
  `src/spp.py` is as remained as executable. This update is change file
  mode.

  controller: fix warning for pyyaml loader
