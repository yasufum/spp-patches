Subject: [PATCH v2 0/2] Update makefile and gitignore

As dedicated vhost PMD is added to SPP project, this series of patches
is to update Makefile for cleaning up all files generated while
compiling, and .gitignore to exclude the file from under the management
of git.

  * Add _postclean in the files
  * Divide dist-clean task into two tasks to remove _postclean

Yasufumi Ogawa (2):
  makefile: update dist-clean task
  project: add gitignore entries for vhost PMD
