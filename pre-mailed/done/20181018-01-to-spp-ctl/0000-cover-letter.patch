Subject: [PATCH 0/9] Change SPP controller to use spp-ctl

SPP controller manages primary and secondary processes, and create TCP
sessions while launching. Other process is not allowed to manage SPP
processes directly without using management port. It is difficult to
manage from other process via management port for supporting detailed
operations.

It is better to manage SPP by spp-ctl and to change SPP controller as a
client because it is allowed to maange it from multiple controllers via
well-defined REST APIs. This update is to change SPP controller to a
client of spp-ctl.

For requesting spp-ctl, add SppCtlClient class to send and receive
messages as a client. SppCtlClient communicates with spp-ctl via port
7777 and using REST APIS. The previous TCP connections between from SPP
controller to each of SPP processes are obsolated for the update.

This series of patches also include refactors of 'shell.py' to improve
maintainability. Each of SPP commands, for instance pri or sec, are
moved to deligator classes SppPrimary or SppSecondary contained in
'commands' directory.

Yasufumi Ogawa (9):
  controller: add spp-ctl client for SPP controller
  controller: change controller to use spp-ctl
  spp-ctl: add IP address binding
  controller: add IP address and port binding
  controller: move pri command to SppPrimary
  controller: move sec command to SppSecondary
  controller: move topo command to SppTopo
  controller: move topo_resize command to SppTopo
  controller: move bye command to SppBye
