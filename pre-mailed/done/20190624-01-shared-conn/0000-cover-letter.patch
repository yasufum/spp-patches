Subject: [PATCH 0/2] Rename shared lib command_conn

Shared libs of SPP workers for connecting to spp-ctl are defined in
`command_conn.c` and `command_conn.h`. This update is to rename
`command_conn` to `conn_spp_ctl` to be explicitly it is just for
spp-ctl. This update also renames functions in these files.

  shared/sec: revise funcs to connect to spp-ctl
  shared/sec: rename command_conn.c
