Subject: [PATCH 0/2] Add REST APIs for add or del port to spp_primary

Spp_primary is designed to only have physical ports and initialize them
at the process is started. It is because development of spp_primary was
started before vdev is introduced.

However, Spp_primary can support adding or deleting port dynamically by
using hotplug features currently as same as secondary processes. This
update is to add the features for spp_primary, and add REST API for.
SPP CLI does not support to add or delete for spp_primary yet.

Yasufumi Ogawa (2):
  spp_primary: add commands to add and del port
  spp-ctl: add port add and del APIs for spp_primary
