Subject: [PATCH 0/3] Refactor spp_priamry

Implementation of spp_primary is derived from DPDK's multi process
sample app, and some of variable names are remained old after the usage
is changed. For example, `client` or `num_client` was used for rings for
communicating with clients, but it is used for ring port used to
forward. This series of patches is to refactor spp_primary and its
Makefile.

Yasufumi Ogawa (3):
  spp_primary: refactor var names for ring ports
  spp_primary: change include path in Makefile
  spp_primary: add lcore_id_used variable
