Subject: [PATCH 0/2] Update SPP controller

Hi,

For awaited `exit` command is supported in spp_vf and spp_mirror, it is
time for updating spp-ctl and CLI. This series of patches also includes
adding spp_pcap support which is yet another packet capture feature of
SPP. The series of patches of spp_pcap itself is sent after this
updates.

Thanks,
Yasufumi
