Subject: [PATCH 0/4] Port management with resource UID

Resource UID (called resource ID previously) consists of port type and
port ID was introduced to specify a port. For example, users can patch
ports as following.

  spp > sec 1; patch phy:0 ring:0  # instead of 'patch 0 1'

However, add and del commands are still remained using old style of
resource UID.

  spp > sec 1; add ring 0  # should be updated to 'add ring:0'

This series of patches is to update the usage of resource UID.

* Add a common function parse_resource_uid() to extract port type and ID
  from resource UID.

* Update spp_nfv and spp_vm to use parse_resource_uid().

* Update add and del command in SPP controller to use the latest style
  of resource UID.

Yasufumi Ogawa (4):
  shared: add parsing resource UID
  spp_nfv: change to use parse_resource_uid
  spp_vm: change to use parse_resource_uid
  controller: unify accepting resource UID format
