Subject: [PATCH 0/5] Add error handling for add and del commands

There is no strict checking for returned value of parsing resource UID
for add and del commands. It might cause a fatal error if no existing
resource is accessed for inappropriate resource UID.

To avoid inappropriate accessing, add checking for the resource UID and
correct determining of the returned value. This update also includes
refactors of log messages in add_ring_pmd() to create a ring port
correctly.

Yasufumi Ogawa (5):
  shared: add error handling for invalid res UID
  spp_nfv: add error handling for add and del cmd
  spp_vm: add error handling for add and del cmd
  spp_nfv: refactor add_ring_pmd
  spp_vm: refactor add_ring_pmd
