Subject: [PATCH 0/6] Fix bug of assigning ports

This series of patches is to fix the error for adding, deleting and
patching incorrect ports which is cannot craete or does not exist. To
fix the bug, correct determining the existing port with
parse_resource_uid(). One of the reasons for the bug is that is
imcomplete to catch up with changing to uint16_t for port_id and Some of
checking port_id are incorrect.

This update is to correct the bug of managing ports, and also refactor
log messages for add, del and patch commands.
