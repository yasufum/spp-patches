Subject: [PATCH 0/5] Revising logs and comments in shared

This series of patches is to refactor log messages and comments for
code maintenance.

* Rename functions start with `dump_` used for not dumping messages but
  logging.

* Revise ambiguous variables start with `num_` used for "Number of" or
  exact number. Former one is renamed as starts with `nof_`.

* Revise terms of funcs and vars which are not correct meaning for
  usages.

Yasufumi Ogawa (5):
  shared/sec: revise comments in cmd_utils.h
  shared/sec: rename funcs start with dump
  shared/sec: revise member of struct for interface
  shared/sec: rename defines for length of str
  shared/sec: add prefix to defines of worker types
