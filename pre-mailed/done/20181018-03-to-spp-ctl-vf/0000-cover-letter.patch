Subject: [PATCH 0/4] Add commands of spp_vf to SPP controller

Spp_vf has dedicated controller 'spp_vf.py' and is not managed from
'spp.py'. It is confusing to users.

Thanks to spp-ctl, it is easy to send a request to spp_vf from 'spp.py'
without any effort. This update is to add SppVf class behaviour as a
client for spp-ctl. An instance of the class is intended to be used
from do_vf() and complete_vf() methods of Shell class in 'spp.py'.

'spp_vf.py' is removed in this update because all of this features are
moved to 'spp.py' and is not used anymore.

Yasufumi Ogawa (4):
  controller: add POST method for spp-ctl
  controller: add SppVf class
  controller: add vf command to SPP controller
  spp_vf: remove spp_vf controller
