Subject: [PATCH 0/1] Update to 18.05.1

Hi,

SPP is largely updated from v18.05. SPP controller is divided into
spp-ctl and CLI to support multiple controllers. In addition, several
bug fixes and updates of documentation are made from v18.05. Now it the
time to update SPP to v18.05.1.

Thanks,
Yasufumi
