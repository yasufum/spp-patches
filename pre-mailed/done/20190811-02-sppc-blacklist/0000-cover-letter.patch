Subject: [PATCH 0/3] Add blacklist EAL option for SPP container

PP container is expected to be used on a host which has no ports on
host for simplicity. However, it might have some port in a realistic
situation actually.

In such a case, ports on host should be excluded with blacklist option
to avoid confliction using the same ports from SPP on host and app
containers. Without this option, system causes unexpected behavior.

This series of update is to add blacklist option ``-b`` and
``--pci-blacklist`` to app container tools and descriptions of usage
for the option in documentation.
